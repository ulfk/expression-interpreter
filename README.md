# Expression Interpreter
Example implmentation of an interpreter for mathematical expressions.

The mathematical expression may consist of these parts:
- the mathematical operators for addition (+), subtraction (-) and multiplication (*)
- constant positive integer numbers (the '-' is only interpreted as operator not as sign)
- variable names consisting of one lowercase character in the range from "a" to "z".
- brackets as needed for grouping parts of the expression
- spaces are allowed anywhere in the expression.

The expression must be given as string to the constuctor of `ExpressionInterpreter`. To calculate the value of the expression the method `CalculateWith` can be called with a list of the variable values to be used in the calculation.

Some expression examples:
- 3 + 4
- 7 * ( a + b * (17 - c)) + 2
- x*y+z
